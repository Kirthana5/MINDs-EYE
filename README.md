# Mind's Eye
A Super interactive game especially for ADHD children.
In order to run this project efficiently,some library files are needed.One should have to to download those setup files and have to add them to the libraries.

1. For playing audio files ,the library file required is, http://jacomp3player.sourceforge.net/

2. As layout used in some coding is AbsolouteLayout, there's a need to add them to libraries.But there's no need to download the setup for this,if we've Netbeans 8.2 RC.Beacuse in that case,this jar file will be present in our C drive in the path C:\Program Files\NetBeans 8.2 RC\java\modules\ext.

Incase , if you can't go with the above steps,then you can simply download these jar files from our repository.We've uploaded those two inside the library folder.
